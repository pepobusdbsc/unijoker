    You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for your behaviour while accessing or using the Service, as well as any associated consequences. The prices of blockchain assets are extremely volatile. Price fluctuations in other digital assets may have a materially negative effect on the value of Cryptocurrency Tokens, which may also experience significant price volatility. There are risks associated with using an Internet-based currency, including the possibility of hardware, software, and Internet connections failing, the introduction of malicious software, and the risk of third parties gaining unauthorised access to your assets. You accept and acknowledge that we will not be liable for any communication breakdowns, disruptions, errors, distortions, or delays, regardless of how they occur. The regulatory framework governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, and tokens is in flux, and new regulations or policies could have a materially negative impact on cryptocurrency development and use. We accept no responsibility for regulatory violations committed anywhere in the world. </p>
